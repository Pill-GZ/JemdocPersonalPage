= Some trivial (but not obvious) things

 - There is little reason to unanimously prefer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_method Fisher's method] (sum of negative log p-values) over, say, Edginton's Method (sum of p-values) for combining p-values (although it is better known that Fisher's method and Bonferroni's method are good at picking out different alternatives). In some cases of small and distributed effects, the latter wins; see [./combine_p-values.html numerical example], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_method\#cite_note-8 theory].

 - You cannot arbitrarily design full conditional distributions and expect them to be compatible (only when they are compatible can you use Brook's lemma). I was suprised how this is glossed over by many people. ([./incompatible_full_conditionals.html numerical example], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289858 theory])

 - [./tree_distance_metric.html Some thoughts on trees and distance metrics]. You can recover the tree structure from the distance matrix of its nodes. (see [./tree_distance_matrix.html an R script])
