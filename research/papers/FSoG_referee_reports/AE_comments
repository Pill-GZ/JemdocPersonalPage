Editor comments:

'Two referees seem to like the paper, praising especially the GWAS application context. Referee 3, however, is scathing, about the technical level and quality of writing, but more importantly about the novelty. 

I don't agree with Referee 3 about the writing. I think it is a very readable paper. The novelty is paramount, however, and I am convinced by Referee 3 that the novelty is lacking. 

Regarding remaining novelty, there is the extension from the one- to the two-sided case, which is not too impressive to me, and the application context to GWAS, which both Referees 1 and 2 mention as a strong point. I am not too convinced by the latter myself. I don't see these results being used in practice, especially since the GWAS field is rapidly moving away from the assumption of sparsity, which seems more and more untenable for GWAS.

To sum up, I suggest to follow Referee 3's verdict.'
