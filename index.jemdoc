I am currently a Ph.D. student at  
[https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/ Department of Statistics] at 
[https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan], advised by [http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~sstoev/ Stilian Stoev]

My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, large-scale multiple testing, extremes values, algorithms on data streams, and their applications in cybersecurity and biomedical sciences. 

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in [https://www.ise.nus.edu.sg/ Industrial and Systems Engineering] from [http://www.nus.edu.sg/ National University of Singapore]. I also studied [http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/ecs/ Economics] and [http://ww1.math.nus.edu.sg/ Mathematics].
