I have graduate in 2020 from the [https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/ Department of Statistics] at 
[https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan], under the supervision of [http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~sstoev/ Stilian Stoev].

I am driven by real data problems, and develop theories (if they are relevant), software (if they are useful), and new methods (only when necessary).

Applications in cybersecurity and genetics have led me to study high-dimensional statistics, large-scale multiple testing, extremes values, and algorithms on data streams.
